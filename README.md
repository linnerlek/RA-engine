# Relational Algebra Interpreter

This project is an implementation of a Relational Algebra interpreter in Python. The RA-Engine allows you to run relational algebra queries in the terminal, providing a convenient way to manipulate and query relational databases.

To use RA-Engine, ensure you have the PLY package installed. You can find the PLY package [here](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html). 

## Features

- **Terminal-Based Execution**: Run the RA-Engine from the command line with a simple command like `python3 RA.py company`, where "company" is the folder containing your database.

- **Example Database Included**: Explore the functionality immediately with the provided example database folder. The project includes a sample dataset to help you get started.

- **Query Examples**: A collection of seven example queries is included in a text file, demonstrating the syntax and capabilities of the RA-Engine. Simply run `python3 RA.py company` followed by the queries to see the results.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the RA-Engine with the command `python3 RA.py <your-database-folder>`.

Feel free to customize the RA-Engine to fit your needs or contribute to its development. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or pull request.

**Note:** This project was created as part of a csc1302 honors lab, making it an excellent resource for students learning about relational databases and algebra.
